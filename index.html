            <h2>The old ship hare</h2>
            <p>Surviving clay tablets and containers record the use of waterborne vessels as early as 4000 BCE. Boats
                are still vital aids to movement, even those little changed in form during that 6,000-year history. The
                very fact that boats may be quite easily identified in illustrations of great antiquity shows how slow
                and continuous had been this evolution until just 150 years ago. And though that was the time when steam
                propulsion became predominant, it never was anywhere universal in local transport. Because some
                solutions to the problem of providing water transport were eminently successful and efficient several
                millennia ago, there are a number of boats still in use whose origins are lost in prehistory.
